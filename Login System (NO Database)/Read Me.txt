Basic Login System and session Management:

> use the login.php file to login - currently, no database script is attached hence the username and password are given in the file itself.
username = chan password = pwd

> Once after login is successfull, a new session is created and we can access that from session.php

> The session lasts for around 24 minutes (can change it in php.ini file).

> Clicking on logout destroys the session.
